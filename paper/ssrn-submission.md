Alpha Asymmetry in FX Markets

## Abstract
This paper investigates whether distributional asymmetries in foreign exchange alpha signals represent exploitable market inefficiencies. Using EUR/JPY data spanning November 2015–August 2025 (510 weekly observations), we document statistically significant departures from normality across five alpha types, with pronounced right-skewness in tail alpha (5.05) and momentum signals (2.12). However, we find that these asymmetries do not translate to economically significant trading profits. The GPD shape parameter is not significantly different from zero (ξ = −0.23, 95% CI: [−1.79, 0.24]), indicating asymmetry arises from outlier frequency rather than heavy tails. Strategy returns include zero in confidence intervals after HAC correction; cross-market validation fails for equities and commodities; and transaction costs eliminate the modest gross edge. We conclude that alpha signal asymmetry, while statistically detectable, does not constitute an exploitable market inefficiency in FX markets. These null findings caution against over-interpreting higher-moment statistics as trading signals without rigorous economic validation.
