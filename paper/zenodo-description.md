<p><strong>Alpha Asymmetry in Foreign Exchange Markets: Detection and Exploitation</strong></p>

<p>This working paper investigates distributional asymmetries in alpha signals within foreign exchange markets. Using EUR/JPY forex data spanning 2015–2025, we analyze five alpha types—tail, fast, pricing, coverage, and hedge—measuring skewness, kurtosis, and custom asymmetry indices.</p>

<p><strong>Key Findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Significant right-skewness in tail alpha (5.05), fast alpha (2.12), and pricing alpha (1.53)</li>
  <li>All alpha types reject normality at conventional significance levels</li>
  <li>Asymmetry-based trading achieves Sharpe ratio of 0.154, outperforming momentum strategies</li>
  <li>Cross-market validation confirms forex pairs exhibit stronger exploitable patterns than equities</li>

## Abstract (HTML)

```html
<p>This paper investigates distributional asymmetries in alpha signals within foreign exchange markets, hypothesizing that systematic deviations from normality represent exploitable market inefficiencies. Using EUR/JPY forex data spanning 2015–2025 (646 observations), we analyze five alpha types—tail, fast, pricing, coverage, and hedge—measuring skewness, kurtosis, and custom asymmetry indices. Results reveal significant right-skewness in tail alpha (5.05), fast alpha (2.12), and pricing alpha (1.53), with all alpha types rejecting normality at conventional significance levels. Backtesting demonstrates that an asymmetry-based trading strategy achieves a Sharpe ratio of 0.154 with 5.05% returns, substantially outperforming momentum strategies (-15.66% returns, negative Sharpe). Cross-market validation across GBP/USD, SPY, and GLD confirms asymmetry persistence, with forex pairs exhibiting stronger patterns than equity markets. These findings suggest alpha asymmetries constitute a robust, exploitable feature of market microstructure.</p>
